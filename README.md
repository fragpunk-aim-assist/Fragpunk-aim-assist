- **Auto-Aim**: The tool helps automatically adjust the player's aim toward nearby enemies, ensuring that the shots hit their intended target more consistently.
- **Snap Aiming**: It makes it easier to "snap" to enemies when aiming near them, reducing the effort and reaction time needed to target opponents, especially in fast-paced situations.
- **Target Tracking**: Automatically adjusts the player's aim to follow enemy movements, ensuring continuous tracking of the target during combat.
- **Bullet Magnetism**: Slightly increases the accuracy of shots, making it easier for players to hit moving or difficult-to-target enemies.
- **Smooth Aiming**: Instead of making sudden, jerky movements, the aim assist adjusts the player’s aim smoothly, giving the experience a more natural feel.

**Customizable Settings**: Many aim assist tools provide players with the option to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the assistance, allowing for a more tailored experience depending on personal preferences.

**Ethical and Legal Considerations:**

- **Game Balance**: Aim assist is sometimes seen as an unfair advantage in competitive multiplayer modes, as it reduces the skill required for precise aiming, potentially affecting the game's balance.
- **Violations of Terms of Service**: In some games, using aim assist through external tools (especially third-party software) may violate the game's terms of service, risking account bans or penalties.
- **Impact on Fair Play**: Although aim assist is often used in single-player or as a feature in some games to help players, its use in competitive multiplayer may undermine fair play, frustrating legitimate players.

In summary, Fragpunk Aim Assist is a tool designed to improve a player's aiming accuracy by automatically adjusting or aiding in the targeting of enemies. While it can make gameplay easier and more accessible, it may also give players an unfair advantage and is typically not allowed in competitive gaming environments due to its potential to disrupt the balance of play.
